.SH NAME
.PP
.B ntpd-setwait
- sets system time from ntp server before running ntpd daemon.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B ntpd-setwait
.RB [ -f ]
.RB [ -i<ip> ]
.RB < max-deviation >
.RB < ntpd-bin >
.RB [ ntpd-opts ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ntpd-setwait
is very simple program that will do the following:
.PP
* wait indefinitely for internet connection
.br
* read current UTC time from ntp server
.br
* if local and ntp time differance is bigger than
.I max-deviation
- set system time with ntp time
.br
* start
.I ntpd-bin
program.
.PP
If at any point there is an error, program goes back to start and tries again,
until all steps succeed and
.B ntpd-bin
is executed.
.B ntpd-bin
is executed with
.BR execve ()
syscall, so after that
.B ntpd-setwait
cease to exist.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
All options are positional.
.PP
.TP
.B -f
Run program in foreground - this may be usefull when you want to stop system
boot until time is synchronized (pass proper option to your
.B ntpd
to make it go into background if you don't want to hang up your boot
completely).
Or you want to use external supervisor -
remember
.B ntpd
pid will be the same as
.B ntpd-setwait
due to
.BR execve ()
function.
By default, program forks into background.
.TP
.B -i
By default, programs takes ntp server from pool.ntp.org, but if you want
to specify own server (on local network) you can do it by passing -i
argument. Usefull when your board does not really have internet access,
but it can access internal server with ntpd server.
.TP
.RB < max-deviation >
Positional argument.
At startup program will read ntp time and localtime.
If local time is different than the one on the ntp server for more than
.I max-deviation
seconds,
.B ntpd-setwait
will set system time to time returned by ntp server.
.TP
.RB < ntpd-bin >
Positional argument.
Absolute path to
.B ntpd
binary you want to use.
It's usually
.BR /usr/sbin/ntpd .
.TP
.RB [< ntpd-opts >]
Positional and optional argument.
Options that should be passed to
.I ntpd-bin
executable.
